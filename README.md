### Debt Optimizer
- **Debt Snowball**: Pay minimum on all debts, extra on smallest balance
- **Debt Avalanche**: Pay minimum on all debts, extra on highest interest rate
- **Savings**: `Savings = Total Interest (Avalanche) - Total Interest (Snowball)`

### Compound Interest Calculator
- **Future Value**: `FV = PV * (1 + r)^t`
- **Present Value**: `PV = FV / (1 + r)^t`
- **Interest Rate**: `r = (FV/PV)^(1/t) - 1`
- **Time**: `t = ln(FV/PV) / ln(1 + r)`
